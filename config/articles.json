            "body": "<p class=\"article-body\">While waterproof smartphones have been the norm in many Asian countries for some time, it's still a relatively novel concept in the UK. Sony was first out the blocks with its 2013 Xperia Z. Samsung and Apple followed suit. But there's a significant difference between waterproof and water-resistant and that's where IP ratings come in.</p><h2 class=\"article-sidetitle\">What is an IP rating?</h2><p class=\"article-body\">An IP (Ingress Protection) rating tells users exactly how waterproof a product is. The standard was drawn up by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) – a global organisation responsible for setting international standards for electronic devices, including everything from plug points to cameras, portable speakers and smartphones.<p class=\"article-body\">Each IP rating includes two digits, for example, IP67 or IP68 – two of the most common ratings currently found on portable devices including the iPhone 7and Samsung Galaxy S8.</p><h2 class=\"article-sidetitle\">Protection against solids</h2><p class=\"article-body\">An IP (Ingress Protection) rating tells users exactly how waterproof a product is. The standard was drawn up by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) – a global organisation responsible for setting international standards for electronic devices, including everything from plug points to cameras, portable speakers and smartphones.<p class=\"article-body\">Each IP rating includes two digits, for example, IP67 or IP68 – two of the most common ratings currently found on portable devices including the iPhone 7and Samsung Galaxy S8.</p><p class=\"article-body\">The first of the two digits (the 6 in IP67) refers to protection against solids, including dust. Products are rated using a 0-6 scale, with 6 being the most well protected. Here's what each level means:</p></p><ul class=\"article-list\"><li>0 - No protection.</li><li>1 - Protection against objects up to 50mm. Also, protection against any large surface of the body, such as the back of the hand, but no protection against deliberate contact with a body part.</li><li>2 - Protection against objects up to 12.5mm, along with fingers or similar objects.</li><li>3 - Protection against objects up to 2.5mm, such as thick wires or tools.</li><li>4 - Protection against objects up to 1mm, including most wires and screws.</li><li>5 - Not entirely protected from dust, but enough to significantly affect performance significant damage.</li><li>6 - Totally protected against dust.</li></ul><p class=\"article-body\">Sometimes a rating is given as X, rather than a number. This doesn't mean the product doesn't offer any protection, it instead means it hasn't been tested or assigned a level in that area.</p><h2 class=\"article-sidetitle\">Protection against liquids</h2><p class=\"article-body\">An IP (Ingress Protection) rating tells users exactly how waterproof a product is. The standard was drawn up by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) – a global organisation responsible for setting international standards for electronic devices, including everything from plug points to cameras, portable speakers and smartphones.<p class=\"article-body\">The second digit in the IP rating (the 8 in IP68) refers to the level of protection against liquids - here's what they mean:</p><ul class=\"article-list\"><li>0 - No protection.</li><li>1 - Minimal protection against vertical drops of water, such as very light rain.</li><li>2 - Protected by vertical drops of water when the device is tilted at 15° from its normal position.</li><li>3 - Protection against sprays of water when the device is tilted at 60° from its usual position, including rain.</li><li>4 - Protection from sprays and splashes of water from any direction.</li><li>5 - Protection against water sprayed directly from a low-pressure nozzle measuring 6.3mm, from any direction.</li><li>6 - Protection from high-powered water jets with a 12.5mm nozzle, from any direction, such as a shower.</li><li>7- Protected for up to 1m of immersion for up to 30 minutes, including splashing from a shower or an accidental (and brief) dunking.</li><li>8 - Protection against submersion beyond 1m. May mean that device is hermetically sealed or merely that any water that can get inside will cause no damage.</li></ul><p class=\"article-body\">Somewhat confusingly, just because a device has been rated at level 8 for waterproofing, does not mean it has passed tests for the levels below it. For example, while the iPhone 7 has an iP67 rating meaning it can withstand brief submersion, it hasn't been rated to survive a jet of water (levels 5 and 6). So while it would survive being dropped in the bath, Apple admits the phone should not be taken into the shower. Liquid damage is not covered under warranty.</p><p class=\"article-body\">In contrast, the Sony Xperia ZX Premium has a rating of IP65/68 meaning it can withstand both a shower and a dunking.</p>",

            "body": "<p class=\"article-body\">If there’s anything Bungie wants you to know about Destiny 2 — a sequel to the addictive, ambitious, and oftentimes frustrating online-only shooter — it’s that the game will actually respect your time. During the first gameplay reveal in Los Angeles yesterday, Bungie executives took the stage to outline the substantial quality of life improvements the sequel will introduce to make this happen.</p><p class=\"article-body\">From removing the need to load in and out of one area for different activities to letting players more easily group up with strangers, Bungie is going to great lengths to paint its new installment as a more thoughtful, well-meaning, and accessible video game. “We want Destiny to not feel like work and feel like it’s taking up your life,” says M.E. Chung, a game designer at Bungie who specializes on the series’ social dynamics. “We want it to fit into your life schedule.”</p><p class=\"article-body\">For many hardcore players, the original Destiny sometimes felt like a second job. On top of the grind of daily play and the ever-increasing amount of items to collect, Destiny was hobbled by befuddling design choices and maddening technical constraints. Players complained endlessly about not having enough space for all their gear and weapons, the lack of narrative and cinematic direction, and an almost Kafkaesque progression system. (Ask any longtime player and they can recount horror stories of repetitive materials farming and the nihilistic cruelty of the game’s random number generator.) Destiny spent its first year looking like an extended beta, as Bungie tweaked and changed it constantly in response to player feedback.</p><p class=\"article-body\">The end result was a title that reminded players that their time just might be better spent elsewhere, creating a constant tug-of-war battle between that nagging feeling and the satisfying, dopamine rush of another new piece of loot or a hard-fought victory. For those without a dedicated group of friends to play with, Destiny could feel like an alienating and isolated experience. With all the the window dressing of its social infrastructure stripped away, it was just a series of feedback loops and feeble reward systems laid bare — a pretty-looking gun game with nothing to say.</p>",

            "body": "<p class=\"article-body\">Qualcomm has introduced a new system that can charge a car while it's travelling at 'highway speeds'.Called dynamic electric vehicle charging (DEVC), the technology is integrated into a specially-built track, cutting out the need for electric cars to stop at charging stations. The breakthrough could pave the way for the building of more roads capable of charging cars, and an eventual move to other electric vehicles.</p><p class=\"article-body\">Based on the Qualcomm Halo wireless electric vehicle charging technology (WEVC), the DEVC tech can charge two vehicles on the same track simultaneously. What's more, vehicles cn pick up charge while travelling forwards and in reverse.</p><p class=\"article-body\">The technology was demonstrated at the 100-metre FABRIC test track at Satory Versailles, France, where the two vehicles were able to charge at up to 20 kilowatts while travelling at high speed.</p><p class=\"article-body\">The pseudo-acronym FABRIC stands for FeAsiBility analysis and development of on-Road chargIng solutions for future electriC vehicles and is a €9 million (£7.6m) project, mostly funded by the European Commission. Built by VEDECOM, the FABRIC test track was fitted with charging tech by Qualcomm, while VEDECOM and Renault worked together to equip two Renault Kangoo vehicles with the receiving part of the technology.</p>",
